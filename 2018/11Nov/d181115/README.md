# Simple Sieve in C

This is the *Sieve of Eratosthenes* in C.  Most stops are pulled, optimization-wise.  Otherwise, this is just Eratosthenes 101.  In that spirit, I should say that as often as I've seen this in writing, I've never heard it pronounced.  I would pronounce it "Air uh TOS the knees".  YPMV
