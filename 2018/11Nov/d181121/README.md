# Sieve of Sundaram

### It's been here all my life

I did not believe that the simplicity and incredible-ness of Eratosthenes' sieve could have been
outdone.  But then I discovered Sundaram's creation.  I am putting this code on github, even though
it might not work.  It's a fascinating algorithm, but coding it is proving... challenging!

However.  as cool as Sundaram's Sieve is, it is not (at least not yet) easy to master.
And, seeing as today's computers are much faster than the ones in 1934(!)
I'm stickin' with Eratosthenes... for now...
