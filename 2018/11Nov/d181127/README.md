# 128-bit Pollard's Rho in C

This is shamelessly copied from Wikipedia and then painstakingly handcrafted to work with __int128_t values.  It is so slow... You know, it's... It's not just slow... It's... (never mind).

Still, there y'go.. Pollard's Rho (a transcendently brilliant algorithm (John Pollard 1975)) - uses the cyclic nature of a PRNG to find prime factors of large numbers.  Hat is off.
