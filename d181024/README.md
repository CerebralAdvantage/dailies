# Most Significant Digit

There is a book, written by Martin Puryear...
It's called "Algorithm Challenges - The Dojo Collection"
It's a fantastic book, dealing essentially with javascript
and covering a wide variety of problems (challenges),
both trivial and mind-bending.

On page 32 of "Algorithm Challenges..." is the
Most Significant Digit challenge, copied here without
knowledge or permission of the author (although I *have*
tried to track him down!)

"...Given number of any size, return the most significant digit. If you already know what strings are, that’s great! However, don’t use them here . Hint: use WHILE to bring the most significant digit into range where you can use the friendly modulus operator ( % ). The most significant digit is the leftmost non-zero digit of a number. Given 12345 , return 1 . Given 67.89 , return 6 . Given 0.00987 , return 9 .

Second: handle negative num values as well, doing what you think is appropriate. "
