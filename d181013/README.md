# Buzz of Eratosthenes

This takes fizz.js and opts to optimize it, if only in look and feel.
I hope you relish the changes as much as I.

And after all that WHINING, below?...  git totally marked fizz.js as being
yesterday's project, because THAT'S WHEN I COMMITTED.  Doesn't matter when
I pushed!

---
How well is this going?  I should have pushed day 1 YESTERDAY.
Why didn't I?  HAVEN'T RELEARNED HOW, YET.  How does that look?
Not great.  But it does do two things.

First, it shows I'm keeping it real

Second, it shows the "broken window" of the git experience.

Can we fix it?  Today?  Wanna say, "heck yeah."

Guess there's more than one broken widow with the
git UI.

cd dailies
md new daily dir
nano new daily file
git status gives wierd error
cd ..; git status shows new daily dir needing adding
git add . adds everything
git status shows full path of added dir & file
