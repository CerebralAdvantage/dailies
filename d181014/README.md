# Recursive Subsets

But first, a little about me.  I was born in a small town in Southwestern Virginia.  And that was it.  That was my last "normal contact" with my cultural milieux.  Oh, I've tried, since then.  And I've seen humans like myself, as they grouped and regrouped in desperation.  I gave up early and regretted it often.  But I will always be, affectionately, your Resident Alien.

The task was simple.  Take a string "abcde" and generate all the ordered subsets.  By "ordered", it means 'cd', 'cde', and 'ce' are all correct, but 'cb' and 'ca' are not good.  The task was to come up with a recursive method, and you could print the results in any order (like all the strings that start with "e" followed by all the strings that start with "d", whatever), but it had to be an exhaustive list of unique, ordered subsets.  And you had to use recursion.

I showed up late for class that day, so there was about 15 minutes left.  I got hold of the problem, and my inner pit bull took over (as is its wont).  I had a solution in about 20 minutes, as everyone else was heading back to "call it a day" for algorithms.  I was pretty stoked until I realized that my delightful theory failed in practice.  So I toughed it out for another 30, while trying to also take notes on the lecture du jour.  Finally got it.  Here it is, embedded in HTML, with way too many comments.  Including these.
