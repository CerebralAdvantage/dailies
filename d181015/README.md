# Three Sum

There is a book, written by Martin Puryear...
It's called "Algorithm Challenges - The Dojo Collection"
It's a fantastic book, dealing essentially with javascript
and covering a wide variety of problems (challenges),
both trivial and mind-bending.

Toward the end, he covers a variety of optimizations,
including a problem called "Closest Three Sum"
The idea is that you have a array of random numbers
and you want to find 3 numbers within the array
whose sum is closest to a random target value.
