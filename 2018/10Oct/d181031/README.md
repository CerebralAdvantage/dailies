# RotateArray

This program will rotate an arbitrarily-large array by an arbitrary amount in O(n).  exactly n steps.

If you wish to rotate an array of 17,500,000 by 327,800, it will loop precisely 17,500,000 times.
It rotates the array in place, using only one temp variable for swapping.

It is *exceedingly* efficient.

caveat: If your array is too large (100,000,000 for instance, on my old laptop) it will crash,
leaving one of your CPUs to sear until you reboot.

So watch it.

But most of all, have fun!
